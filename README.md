# Create a cleverHome platform

## Overview

We live in an exciting time where we have so many choices when considering buying new appliances and smart home devices. Each company has their own apps they use and many times we need to mix and match the devices that would best suite our needs and our budget. You have too many apps on your phone already and many smart home devices each come with their own app as well. We are going to unify these notifications and create our own customised messages via a Telegram bot. The blog post with more detail is available here:

- [Give your cleverHome one voice](https://h3xagn.com/give-your-cleverhome-one-voice/)

## Repo structure and file descriptions

- `main.py`: Simple Python script to get measurements, determine if the state has changed and send a Telegram message.

The dependencies and virtual environment details are located in the `Pipfile` which can be used with `pipenv`.
